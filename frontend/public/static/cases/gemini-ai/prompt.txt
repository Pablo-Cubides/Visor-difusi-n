Ultra realistic, 8K resolution cinematic image of a person crouching beside a powerful black horse in a snow-covered mountainous landscape. Face with the face from the uploaded image, keeping the facial features exactly the same. Wavy hair, and wears dark sunglasses, a cozy black sweater, grey cargo pants, and black boots. He crouches with one knee bent, holding the reins of the horse with a relaxed yet confident posture. The horse is muscular, with a glossy jet-black coat, flowing mane, and expressive eyes, wearing a simple leather halter. Snow blankets the ground with footprints and scattered rocks visible. In the background, soft-focus snow-covered hills, pine trees, and distant mountain peaks stretch under a clear blue sky. Snowflakes gently fall around them, adding depth and softness to the scene. The lighting is soft and natural, highlighting details like the texture of the snow, fabric folds, and hair strands. The overall mood is calm, adventurous, and majestic, evoking a sense of freedom and harmony with nature.
